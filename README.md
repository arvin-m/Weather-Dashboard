# Weather-Dashboard

 I build a weather dashboard application with search functionality to find current weather conditions and the future weather outlook for multiple cities.
 And also this application has access to your current location. if you allow the browser to use your current location,it's shows your current location weather information.
  This application include a search history so that users can access their past search terms.also include a 5-Day Forecast below the current weather conditions.
